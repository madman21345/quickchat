# QuickChat FrontEnd
just a front end display of a chatroom app
learned a lot about design



## next
add timestamps with message
ideally i want to render everything dynamically with javascript/react
empty the html; everything come from the js file
and then be able to swap between conversations and add/delete/archive conversations, which would need a way to store each conversation
and then maybe be able to chat locally
